/*
  LEGACY BACKUP — quiz_data.dart

  The original quiz definitions were migrated to the per-level files under
  `lib/backend/quizzes/`:
    - lib/backend/quizzes/models.dart
    - lib/backend/quizzes/beginner.dart
    - lib/backend/quizzes/intermediate.dart

  This placeholder file is intentionally empty of executable code to avoid
  duplicate class/model definitions while keeping a local backup under
  `lib/backend/quiz_data.dart.bak`.

  If you need the original contents, refer to the backup file
  `lib/backend/quiz_data.dart.bak` or the Git history.
